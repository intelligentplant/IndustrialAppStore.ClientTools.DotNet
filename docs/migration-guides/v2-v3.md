# Migration Guide: v2 to v3

Version 3 of the client tools contain several breaking changes. This document describes the changes that need to be made to migrate from version 2 to version 3.


# ASP.NET Core Authentication

For simple authentication cases (i.e. those that use the default session cookie-based `ITokenStore`), the call to register Industrial App Store services and authentication schemes is unchanged:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddIndustrialAppStoreAuthentication(options => {
    // Bind the settings from the app configuration to the Industrial App Store 
    // authentication options.
    configuration.GetSection("IAS").Bind(options);

    // Redirect to our login page when an authentication challenge is issued.
    options.LoginPath = new PathString("/Account/Login");
});
```

Note however, that the return type of the `AddIndustrialAppStoreAuthentication` extension method has changed from `IServiceCollection` to `IIndustrialAppStoreBuilder`.

Additionally, the `IndustrialAppStoreAuthenticationOptions.ConfigureHttpClient` property has been removed. If you were using this property to configure the HTTP client registration for the Industrial App Store API client, this must now be done using the `AddApiClient` extension method for `IIndustrialAppStoreBuilder` instead:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddIndustrialAppStoreAuthentication(options => {
        // Configure options as normal here.
    })
    .AddApiClient(configureHttpBuilder: http => http
        // Add configuration-based resilience handling 
        // via Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience.
        .AddStandardResilienceHandler(builder.Configuration));
```


# Changes to API Client Types

You should use the `IntelligentPlant.IndustrialAppStore.Client.IndustrialAppStoreHttpClient` class to query the Industrial App Store APIs and the `IntelligentPlant.DataCore.Client.DataCoreHttpClient` class to query an on-premises Data Core instance. 

Generic versions of these classes and other derived types (such as `BackchannelIndustrialAppStoreHttpClient`) have been removed.

Note that the namespaces for the client types may be different to those used in applications using the v2 client tools and you may need to update your `using` directives accordingly.


## Removal of Context Parameter from API Methods

The API client types no longer define a context parameter type (such as an `HttpContext`) that can be specified as a parameter when calling an API method.

You will likely have to refactor all API calls in your application (in particular ASP.NET Core applications that call Industrial App Store APIs) to remove the context parameter from each API method call.


## Authenticating Outgoing API Requests

Instead of passing a context parameter to each API call to provide authentication information, both `IndustrialAppStoreHttpClient` and `DataCoreHttpClient` now expect the `HttpClient` passed to their constructor to be pre-configured to supply all the authentication information required to be able to authenticate outgoing requests.

In ASP.NET Core applications that use the IntelligentPlant.IndustrialAppStore.Authentication library, the `HttpClient` used to construct the API client is now automatically configured to use a bearer token for the calling user, obtained from the scoped `ITokenStore` service.

If you are not using dependency injection to create `IndustrialAppStoreHttpClient` or `DataCoreHttpClient` instances, you can manually modify default request headers on the `HttpClient` used by the API client, or use a custom `DelegatingHandler` to modify outgoing requests.


# Command-Line Apps

The new IntelligentPlant.IndustrialAppStore.CommandLine library provides dependency injection extensions to simplify registering Industrial App Store services for use in command-line applications. This includes the ability to sign a command-line application into the Industrial App Store using the OAuth 2.0 device code authorization grant:

```csharp
services.AddIndustrialAppStoreCliServices(options => {
    options.ClientId = "<YOUR CLIENT ID>";
    // Folder that encrypted authentication tokens will be saved to. Relative 
    // paths are resolved using the user's local application data folder.
    options.AppDataPath = "MyIasApp";
});

var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
using var scope = provider.CreateScope();

var sessionManager = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IndustrialAppStoreSessionManager>();
await sessionManager.SignInAsync((request, ct) => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Please sign in by visiting {request.VerificationUri} and entering the following code: {request.UserCode}");
    return default;
});

var client = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IndustrialAppStoreHttpClient>();
var dataSources = await client.DataSources.GetDataSourcesAsync();
```
