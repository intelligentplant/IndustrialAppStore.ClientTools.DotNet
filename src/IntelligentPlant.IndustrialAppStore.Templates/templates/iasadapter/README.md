# App Store Connect Adapter: MyAdapter

This App Store Connect adapter uses a [starter template](https://github.com/intelligentplant/IndustrialAppStore.ClientTools.DotNet) from the [Industrial App Store](https://appstore.intelligentplant.com).


# Getting Started

The `MyAdapter` and `MyAdapterOptions` classes define the adapter and its runtime options respectively. You can change the names of these classes as you wish.

For information about how to implement adapter features, as well as example projects, please visit the [App Store Connect adapters GitHub repository](https://github.com/intelligentplant/AppStoreConnect.Adapters).
